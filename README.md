# OpenWeather Dashboard

## Description

A weather dashboard that allows the user to search a city and retrieve a current weather forecast for the desired location. This will also include the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index. The colour of the UV index will indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate or severe. On the search result page, the desired weather forecast will also be accompanied by an extended 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed as well as the humidity. Lastly, a search history will populate on the left underneath the search input section, whereby the user will be able to click on a previously searched city and retrieve that updated forecast.
